<h1 class="text-center">Fernanda Hansen de Moraes, Bsc </h1>

<p class="lead text-justify">
Hello, I am Fernanda Hansen P. de Moraes, a PhD student at Instituto D’Or de Pesquisa e Ensino, IDOR supervised by Bruno Mota and [Fernanda Tovar-Moll](tovar-moll.org). I have a Bsc in Medical Physics (UFRJ/BHT-Berlin) and working experience in Imaging Physics.

  
I am currently working with Cortical Folding patterns in humans. We verify its universality (and escaping) across healthy aging, neurodegenerative pathologies (Alzheimer’s Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment), and congenital malformations (Corpus Callosum Disgenesis).

  
In my free time, I enjoy running, biking, Netflix binging, and coffee tasting.
